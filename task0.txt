b) This is an .iso image file. You can "mount" it to a directory on your Linux system
using the so-called "loopback mount".  Do some research on the net and do it.

c) Once you mount the iso file, you can see the contents - you will see folders 
containing .mp4 files.

d) Watch the videos  and try out the commands on your Linux system 
(in the following order):

rl100/cmdline  (all the  files in this folder)

rl100/commands

rl100/vim

rl100/director
