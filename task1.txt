a) Download and extract the pdf files contained in these two files:

http://pramode.net/downloads/shellbasics.tgz (2 pdfs)

http://pramode.net/downloads/git.tgz (3 pdfs)

b) Read and work out the pdf files. Note that you will  be seeing some tricky stuff 
here ... so don't do it  in a hurry. It is VERY important that you work out things 
on the  machine ... just reading is    NOT  enough.

c) Watch the videos in :

rl100/shellbas

rl100/gitbasic

rl100/github

Again, try out stuff on your machine.

d) Create an account on github.com. This account is going to  be very useful for you in the future - so please use a proper user name [if you already have a github account, no need to create a new one]
